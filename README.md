# gopher-pup

Repository for examples of what I have learned while trying to become a fully fledged gopher.

- [godocsearch](/godocsearch/) _Document keyword search in a command line application_.

- [gohrdatabase](/gohrdatabase/) _Standard API example with database_.

- [gomulti-task](/gomulti-task/) _My sample to understand concurrency in Go_.

And for fun, some [Code Golf](/code-golf/) solutions.
