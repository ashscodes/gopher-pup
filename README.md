# gopher-pup

Repository for examples of what I have learned while trying to become a fully fledged gopher.

- [godocsearch](/godocsearch/) _Document keyword search in a command line application_.

- [godolist](/godolist/) _Standard to-do list with database_.

- [gomulti-task](/gomulti-task/) _My sample to understand concurrency in Go_.

And for fun, some [Code Golf]() solutions.
